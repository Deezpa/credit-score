# credit-score
This repository serves as a centralised hub for all things related to credit scoring. 
Welcome to the credit score repository! This project aims to explore and develop machine learning algorithms for credit scoring, with a focus on addressing the challenges posed by consumers with limited credit histories, often face difficulties in obtaining credit due to traditional scoring methods' limitations.
This project seeks to leverage machine learning techniques to develop accurate and reliable credit scoring models specifically tailored for this demographic.
